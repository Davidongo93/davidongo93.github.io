📁 Portfolio Project on GitHub created with Ruby, Jekyll, and Sass

Hello everyone! 👋

This is my personal portfolio project for GitHub, developed using Ruby, Jekyll, and Sass.
The portfolio is based on the Agency theme, a Bootstrap template, which gives my site a modern and elegant design.

If you have any questions, collaboration proposals, or just want to get in touch, feel free to contact me via email at domirandar@unal.edu.co or by phone at +573015740156.

I want to acknowledge the original theme creator for the inspiration! 🙌 Hope you enjoy my portfolio! 😄

🚀 Thank you for visiting my page! 🌟
