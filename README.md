📁 Portfolio Project on GitHub created with Ruby, Jekyll, and Sass.

Hello everyone! 👋

This is my personal portfolio project for GitHub, developed using Ruby, Jekyll, and Sass on Linux. The portfolio is based on the Agency theme, a Bootstrap template, which gives my site a modern and elegant design.
